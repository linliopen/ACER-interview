Question 1

Describe how you would approach designing a resilient and fault-tolerant hosting infrastructure with AWS for an application currently running on an on-premises load-balanced cluster of application servers and a single MySQL database server. How would you configure networking within that infrastructure? What AWS services would you use and why?

answer：
1. Create a VPC instance, create a VPC subnet, select an area near the service area, and plan host IP addresses.  
2. Create a routing table, add route entries, associate them with the subnet, and set the gateway traffic.  
3. Create a VPC security group and set inbound and outbound rules for the VPC.
4. Configure EC2 hosts and  create load Balance and Autoscaling to ensure high availability of the cluster.
5. The multi-master/slave MySQL service implements read/write separation（choose different region and different AZ）.
6. Create Nginx cluster, Redis cluster and PHP application service on this infrastructure.


Question 2

If you are given Windows 10 as your work machine (with 8-core CPUs and 16GB RAM), but you need to work with many Pythons and Linux Bash scripting along with many different Linux based docker containers.

Assuming you cannot change the machine’s operating system and cannot re-partition any of the local HDDs; However, you have admin access to install software and enabling some Windows features.

How would you setup your work environment on the machine?

answer：
Install Virtualization Software, such as vmware workstation, virtualbox, vagrent, docker.
If Python needs to run different versions on the same machine, such as 2.7 or 3.6, you can install Python's virtual environment venv for version isolation.
